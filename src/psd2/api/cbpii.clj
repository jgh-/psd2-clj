  "Payment coverage check request (CBPII)
  ### Description
The CBPII can ask an ASPSP to check if a given amount can be covered by the liquidity that is available on a PSU cash account or payment card.
### Prerequisites
- The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the CBPII role
- The TPP and the PSU have a contract that has been registered by the ASPSP
  - At this step, the ASPSP has delivered an \"Authorization Code\", a \"Resource Owner Password\" or a \"Client Credential\" OAUTH2 access token to the TPP (cf. ยง 3.4.2).
  - Each ASPSP has to implement either the \"Authorization Code\"/\"Resource Owner Password\" or the \"Client Credential\" OAUTH2 access token model.
  - Doing this, it will edit the [security] section on this path in order to specify which model it has chosen
- The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and authentication 
- The TPP has presented its OAUTH2 \"Authorization Code\", \"Resource Owner Password\" or \"Client Credential\" access token which allows the ASPSP to identify the relevant PSU.
### Business flow
The CBPII requests the ASPSP for a payment coverage check against either a bank account or a card primary identifier.
The ASPSP answers with a structure embedding the original request and the result as a Boolean."
